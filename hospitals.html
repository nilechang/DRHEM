                                        You are going to face many challenges throughout your career. As you are about to find out, emergency medicine demands of you the most
                                        intense involvement personally and intellectually.Every area of clinical medicine is practiced, every emotion is taxed. The challenge 
                                        is in managing an endless variety of disease or trauma at a level of immediacy that is rarely approached in any other specialty. Residency    
                                        is a critical juncture in your career, as the habits you form now will forever follow you. Here at Detroit Receiving, we think about this                                       
                                        in designing our residency training program. We have an extraordinarily robust and diverse clinical experience with an emphasis on critical care. 
                                        As an intern, you start with an orientation month and then dive right in to intense learning. You are introduced early on to ultrasound - a tool 
                                        that is invaluable to the practice of EM. As you progress from a PGY1 to  a PGY3, your time spent in the ED and your responsibilities increase. 
                                        But one thing doesn't change; you will still work closely with some of the finest attending physicians in the country.
