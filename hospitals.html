									</header>
									<p>							
                                      Detroit Receiving Hospital (DRH) is an adult, Level 1 Trauma, emergency care hospital with 85,000 patient visits a year. Virtually all admissions are evaluated and managed in the ED. This gives residents repeated opportunity for first patient contact, and allows them to be integrally involved in the decision making process regarding the diagnosis and treatment of emergency patients. The ED at DRH provides a high volume, high acuity, urban population with diverse pathology and advanced stages of disease pathology. There is ample opportunity for both procedural and resuscitative experience. Our ED population includes 20% trauma (both blunt and penetrating), 15% surgical, 55% medical, 5% psychiatric, and 5% obstetrics & gynecology cases.

Residents complete a ward pediatric medicine rotation and one month in the pediatric emergency department during the first year and one month in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit during the second year of training. In addition, to maintain continuity of clinical experience, residents rotate through both DRH and CHM emergency departments during each of 7 EM rotations in the second year, and 10 EM rotations in the third year. Additional pediatric EM experience is gained at our community EM site in the final year of training.
