										Dear Applicants,
										<br /><br />								
                                        You are going to face many challenges throughout your career. As you are about to find out, emergency medicine demands of you the most
                                        intense involvement personally and intellectually.Every area of clinical medicine is practiced, every emotion is taxed. The challenge 
                                        is in managing an endless variety of disease or trauma at a level of immediacy that is rarely approached in any other specialty. Residency    
                                        is a critical juncture in your career, as the habits you form now will forever follow you. Here at Detroit Receiving, we think about this                                       
                                        in designing our residency training program. We have an extraordinarily robust and diverse clinical experience with an emphasis on critical care. 
                                        As an intern, you start with an orientation month and then dive right in to intense learning. You are introduced early on to ultrasound - a tool 
                                        that is invaluable to the practice of EM. As you progress from a PGY1 to  a PGY3, your time spent in the ED and your responsibilities increase. 
                                        But one thing doesn't change; you will still work closely with some of the finest attending physicians in the country.
                                        <br /> <br />
                                        Residency is a time to gain experience in a variety of practice settings. Although our base hospital is in the inner city, our residents also work 
                                        at Huron Valley Hospital, which is a community hospital. You also rotate at Harper University hospital, which is a tertiary care center caring for 
                                        patients with complex medical histories. Your pediatric EM experience is exceptional.  We are fortunate to have our residents train at one of the 
                                        busiest pediatric hospitals in the nation, Children's Hospital of Michigan.
                                        <br /> <br />
                                        We take pride in our weekly educational conference series. It is so popular that often there is not an empty seat available. We moved away from the
                                        traditional 1-hour lecture format -- this is not the way your generation learns best -- and replaced it with more active learning sessions and hands 
                                        on activities. We also look for opportunities to introduce new technologies into conference. We use the resident website (drhem.com) to post interesting
                                        and challenging cases. We have speakers from across the country give talks via Skype, we have our own web-based Board Review website, all of our conferences
                                        are digitally recorded, and we are supporters of #FOAMed. This is just a taste of where we are headed with integrating the newest educational technologies 
                                        into the residency. Your education continues outside of the lecture hall with our state-of-the-art simulation center that our residents get to participate
                                        in through all 3 years of residency and cadaver lab, where you can actually take your time when performing a thoracotomy.
                                        <br /> <br />
                                        As you are aware, the cornerstone to advancing medicine relies on high quality research. Our department is flush with research opportunities and is ranked 
                                        15th nationwide in NIH funding and ranked 1st overall for Emergency Medicine Foundation (EMF) grants. We have multiple clinical trials ongoing in our ED at 
                                        any one time. If you have an interest in research, you can work closely with one of the research faculty to develop and implement your own project. Many 
                                        residents present their research at a National Conference.
                                        <br /> <br />
                                        We believe in a strong academic culture and a dedication to the finest patient care. On a daily basis, you will face the challenge of administering care 
                                        to heroin abusers who continually overdose, to dialysis patients who abuse cocaine, to diabetics who can't afford insulin, and alcoholics who are belligerent 
                                        and abusive. But, you have taken a pledge to care for these patients no differently than the wealthy man having a heart attack or the athletic teenager with 
                                        a sprained ankle.  You have pledged to have an attitude of warmth and compassion, a task sometimes very difficult with our ED population. You will often
                                        find yourself acting as the last friend on earth to scores of people who are all but invisible to the majority of Americans. And in that sense, you find 
                                        yourself affirming human worth and dignity among people too easily and too often dismissed.
                                        <br /> <br />
                                        As program director, I pledge to stimulate your professional growth, to encourage you to get involved in emergency medicine on a local, regional, and 
                                        national level, to develop sound clinical reasoning skills, to practice evidence-based medicine, to feel confident in an environment of academic rigor, and to 
                                        prepare you for life after residency whether it is in academics, community medicine, as a director of an ED or even chair of a department.
                                        <br /> <br />
                                        Its been over 40 years since Drs. Ronald Krome, Brooks Bock, Hal Jayne, and Judith Tintinalli began laying the foundation of our residency. These four pioneers 
                                        dedicated their lives to creating our department, our residency, and the specialty in which we practice in today.  What I hope for our residents is to aim to 
                                        live up to their ideals, to continue their vision, and to strive for the same excellence that they practiced since day 1. One of Dr. Ronald Krome's favorite 
                                        sayings is that..."he receives the greatest joy from seeing his students achieve successes greater than his."  It is my hope that we follow in the footsteps 
                                        of Dr. Krome and all of the other dedicated physicians that built our great department of emergency medicine
                                        here at Detroit Receiving.
                                        <br /> <br />
                                        Best Regards,
                                        <br />
                                        Adam Rosh, MD
