										<p id="introtext-1"> The EM-1 curriculum is designed to provide a broad clinical experience within several medical specialties. It begins with an orientation block that helps bridge new residents from medical school so they could hit the ground running. First year residents spend 10 weeks in the adult ED at Detroit Receiving Hospital, 8 weeks in the ED at the Children's Hospital of Michigan, 4 weeks each in orthopedic surgery, trauma surgery, medical-ICU, neuro-ICU, anesthesia, and a dedicated ultrasound rotation. First year residents also have a 2 week rotation at the Hutzel-Women's Hospital for the obstetrics experience as well as 2 additional weeks for electives. Residents receive 4 weeks of vacation each year. The experience gained during the EM-1 year serves as the foundation for the final two years of residency, which emphasize your training in the emergency department and experience resuscitating and stabilizing critically ill or injured patients. </p>

									    <p id="introtext-2"> The EM-2 year emphasizes your development of clinical skills necessary to evaluate and treat patients in the emergency department setting. You will work closely with EM faculty to develop your ability to effectively investigate the chief complaint, consider diagnoses "not to miss", and discern which diagnostic tests or studies are necessary to either identify or exclude emergency conditions. You will become the team leader in resuscitation, and learn to approach patients with life or limb threats in an organized and prioritized manner. You will multitask and work to maintain patient flow as you gain confidence in your clinical decisions and ability to disposition patients from the ED. Critical care blocks in the medical ICU, pediatric ICU, and CCU will help expand your critical care skills and knowledge.</p>
									    <p id="ED-2Blurb" class="blurb">This is something about ED-2.</p>
									    <p id="CCBlurb" class="blurb">The ED-Critical Care rotation focus on providing EM-2 residents with a concentrated bedside experience managing critically ill ED patients. You will spend 100% of your time participating in, learning from, and gaining perspective about critical care management IN the emergency department; this is NOT an ICU-based rotation. The ED-CC resident can expect to benefit from 70-80 critical care ED cases during the rotation in addition to assisting with a number of procedures.  Overall the goal of the ED-CC rotation is to make you competent in providing state-of-the-art care to the patients most critically ill.</p>

									    <p id="introtext-3"> This year is dedicated to the "complete" practice of emergency medicine. During the EM-3 year, each EM block will have you working shifts at DRH, CHM for continuing pediatric experience, and Huron Valley-Sinai Hospital for the community EM training. Each clinical site will expose you to a unique clinical experience, the sum of which will prepare you for virtually any academic or clinical practice for your emergency medicine career. The DRH clinical experience includes both medical and trauma module shifts. You will assume responsibility for your entire module with teaching responsibility toward junior residents and medical students. You will also see patients in the DRH ambulatory rapid care clinic, an urgent care setting. This gives you the opportunity to see a large volume of patients with less acute complaints, learning to trust your clinical judgment to diagnose and treat conditions, without the necessity of multiple tests and diagnostic studies. You will continue adding pediatric clinical experience at CHM under the guidance and supervision of board certified pediatric emergency medicine physicians and fellows-in-training. Huron-Valley Sinai is a very busy community hospital where you will see both adult and pediatric patients. This experience will develop your communication skills in dealing with primary medical doctors and consultants, and perspective learning to determine when patients need to be transferred to a higher level facility. Lastly, one block at Harper University Hospital will give you valuable experience treating challenging adult medical patients with multiple complex co-morbid conditions. The EM-3 year will contribute significantly to your growing "bank" of clinical experience, confidence in your clinical ability and judgment, and skill as an emergency medicine physician reading for independent practice.</p>
